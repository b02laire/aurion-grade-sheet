# Aurion Grade Sheet
Welcome to the Aurion Grade Sheet repo !  
Here, you'll find a Python module that generates a visual representation of all your grades.
   
The Selenium connexion to Webaurion is ~~copy/pasted~~ inspired,  I meant inspired by [this project that you should check out](https://github.com/Warrior62/find-new-marks-wa)
## Features to be added (or not depending on my motivation):
* HTML/PDF Grade Sheet with various visual representations of your notes
* Export to Excel and csv/json file for integration in other projects
* Visual interface using Qt Python
* Integration of grades from the past years by loading the PDFs available in WebAurion
